Was looking into recreating: [CREATETEMP]
Which led to: [ErrNotEnoughMem] (left off at 07:1312), which led to [DelVar]
I got stuck on [DelVar] because it's doing crazy things.
I basically copied [ISINSET] but not sure I can compatibly optimize it.
[CreateVar] was on its own little side-quest. It needs some love.
[FindSym] was referenced in [DelVar], I think. Need to check to see if it
also scans the temp object section. jacobly mentioned that he had a symtab
sort routine followed by a binary search algorithm in place of FindSym. I don't
intend on doing that much.
