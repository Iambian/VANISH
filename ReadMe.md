VANISH - TI-83 Plus Runtime Environment for the TI-84 CE
============================================================
Warning:
* ~~This project only works on the TI-84 Plus CE.~~
  This project doesn't quite work yet. It's only here at this stage
  to prevent local accidents from completely destroying the project.
  Something about backups and stuff.
* This project will not work on the TI-84 Plus CSE.
* This project will not work on the TI-84 Plus (SE). If you have
  that calculator, you don't need this anyway. Go download and play
  the games for that calculator on that calculator.

About
-----
Project VANISH is an environment that helps facilitate the
execution of old games designed for the TI-83 Plus by providing a memory layout,
contents, and base code similar to that of a real TI-83 Plus running
a stock operating system. With minimal tweaks, many assembly programs
and games will be able to run on the TI-84 Plus CE.
  
Motivation
----------
I want geekboy1011 to be able to play Dying Eyes on his CE.

There's supposed to be other things here.
-----------------------------------------
Such as controls and build documentation. None of that here yet.
