VANISH - Partial TI-83 Plus Emulation Layer for the TI-84 CE
============================================================
Warning:
* This project only works on the TI-84 Plus CE.
* This project will not work on the TI-84 Plus CSE.
* This project will not work on the TI-84 Plus (SE). If you have
  that calculator, you don't need this anyway. Go download and play
  the games for that calculator on that calculator.

About
-----
Project VANISH is a partial emulation layer that helps facilitate the
execution of old games designed for the TI-83 Plus by providing an
environment similar to that of the real machine. With minimal tweaks,
many assembly programs and games will be able to run on the TI-84 Plus CE.
  
Motivation
----------
I want geekboy1011 to be able to play Dying Eyes on his CE.

There's supposed to be other things here.
-----------------------------------------
Such as controls and build documentation. None of that here yet.
